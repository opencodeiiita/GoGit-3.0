Hey, I'm Ajay Kumar, rocking my B.Tech at IIIT Allahabad. I'm all about the cool tech trifecta – web development, cybersecurity, and game development. When I'm not coding, you'll catch me binging anime, strategizing on the chessboard, and expressing myself through art. Life's a canvas, and I'm painting it with code and creativity! 🚀💻🎨
