## Answer to the question

Basically Git and GitHub use the term master for the default version of a source code repository. Developers fork a version of the master to create secondary versions, add their code to this default version, and then merge their changes back into the master.
Previously, the name of the default branch of any repository was “master”. But from October-2020 onward, the default branch of any GitHub repository is using “main” as the default branch name, instead of master. However its not mandatory to keep it that way. You can change the name of the default branch which will be appeared in the repositories that you make in the future as “master” or some other name that you want to have.

- New Repositories on GitHub (after the change): If you create a new repository on GitHub, the default branch will be named "main" as part of GitHub's effort to use more inclusive and neutral language.
- Older Repositories on GitHub (before the change):Repositories created on GitHub before the transition may have "master" as the default branch. GitHub has encouraged users to consider updating their default branch names to "main" for consistency and inclusivity. Users can change the default branch name in the repository settings.
- Local Git Repositories:When you initialize a new Git repository locally using the git init command, the default branch created is named "master." However, this is a local convention, and it doesn't have a direct impact on GitHub repositories.
- GitHub Repository Settings:Regardless of when a repository was created or what the default branch was initially set to, you can change the default branch name in the repository settings on GitHub. This allows users to update the default branch name to "main" if it was initially set to "master."
