### Hello Everyone,

- My name is Ayush Sharma, a second year undergraduate from BIET jhansi, pursuing computer science in B.Tech.

- This here is my github pages live link : https://meayushsharma.github.io/

  -Ques - You will see that some repo on GitHub has a main branch as their main but some have a master branch as their main branch. So, please explain in which case Git/GitHub creates main as the main branch and in which case it creates master as the main branch.
  Ans-GitHub has changed the default branch name from "master" to "main" for new repositories.When you create a new repository on GitHub after this change, the default branch is named "main." However, for older repositories or those created before the change, the default branch name remains "master."
