There are some strict rules that you must know before contributing to this project.

- If you want to claim any issue (task), just reply with any message on that issue thread which justifies that you want to work on this issue. Ex :- `Claim`, `I want to work on this issue`, etc. 
- If you are making your first PR, then other than the task provided in the issue section, PR must contain your `info.md` file with some information about you
 at this location: <br>
  ```java
  CONTRIBUTORS / <Ajay Kumar> / <Second Year> / <ajay kumar> / Info.md 
  (White spaces are only for your understanding). For reference you can see my info.md. 
  ```
  
- If I told you to answer a question in any task, then: <br>
`
You must copy that question in your 'info.md' and answer it. Syntax is almost same as you write answers to questions in your notebook. 
` 
- Strictly follow the templates provided inside `.github` directory to make your commits, PR and issues. (Unfollow may leads to PR rejection)
- Visit all the issue labels and read their descriptions carefully.
